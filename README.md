# My solutions to Project Euler Exercises - Javascript (ES2015)

This is a collection of my solutions to the exercises that can be found on the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) website.

Please feel free to use them for reference, I cannot guarantee that they are the best way of achieving the solutions but they have worked for me. **Ideally you should have attempted to solve the problems yourself before looking at these**
